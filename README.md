# cineos SaaS

***_Coming soon_***

cineos is a comprehensive SaaS application designed specifically for cinematographers. Built on the solid foundation of the codingforentrepreneurs/SaaS-Foundations repository, cineos leverages cutting-edge technologies to streamline the film production process. Our stack includes Django for robust backend development, Tailwind CSS for sleek and responsive design, and htmx for dynamic content loading. We utilize Neon Postgres for efficient data management and Redis for high-performance caching.

### Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the sample environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and update the following values:
   - `DJANGO_DEBUG`: Set to 1 for development, 0 for production

### Generate Django Secret Key

Run one of the following commands and copy the output to `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`:

```bash
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```
or
```bash
openssl rand -base64 64
```
or
```bash
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))'
```

### Set Up Neon Postgres Database

1. Install Neon CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install neonctl  # For macOS, use appropriate method for your OS
   ```

2. Authenticate with Neon:
   ```bash
   neonctl auth
   ```

3. Create a new Neon project (optional):
   ```bash
   neonctl projects create --name cineos
   ```

4. Get your project ID:
   ```bash
   PROJECT_ID=$(neonctl projects list | grep "cineos" | awk -F 'â”‚' '{print $2}' | xargs)
   ```

5. Get the database connection string:
   ```bash
   neonctl connection-string --project-id "$PROJECT_ID"
   ```

6. Set the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with the obtained connection string.

### Run Migrations

2. Obtain your Stripe Secret API Key from the Dashboard > Developers > API keys
3. Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` with your key

### Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your cineos instance should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
